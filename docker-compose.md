# Docker Compose

>Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose, see the [list of features](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/#features).
